# TreeBASEMirror

This repo contains DNA MSAs from [TreeBASE](https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html) which we downloaded for our experiments, 
and - for most MSAs - the best trees we found after 100 [RAxML-NG](https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng) tree searches under the "GTR+G" model (with their respective inferred 
model parameters). We substituted the original taxon names since some of them were quite creative and made the parsers in the software we had to use
for our experiments cry. 

There is also a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database with our example scripts [here](https://github.com/angtft/RAxMLGroveScripts), that can be used for easier lookup of MSAs.
